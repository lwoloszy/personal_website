Title: About

After 10 years of academic research in neuroscience, I am pivoting my career towards doing data science outside of the ivory tower. I am both excited and very much looking forward to using quantitative and computational techniques to discover insights and extract meaning from all kinds of new and unfamiliar data sets.

I currently live in beautiful Seattle, WA, with my gorgeous wife Sara, both us having recently relocated from NYC. While we loved our time in the urban jungle, and will dearly miss our favorite bagel, falafel and pizza places, we very much look forward to exploring the amazing outdoor opportunities that the Pacific NW offers.

When I am not coding or learning about things data science related, I can usually be found running, hiking, at a concert near you, or relaxing at home. Having grown up in Dallas during the Cowboys glory days, I am an unabashed fan of all Dallas sports teams. I'm less a fan of the political climate in Texas.
